# Strategy

1. Choose best model for which taxonomic effort for biogeographic realm (BGY) `models-compare-looaic.r`
2. Based on the best model, compare time series predictions `models-compare-ts.r`

# Files

- `models-summary.r` individual diagnostics of model (to identify causes of warning if possible)
- `models-summary.r` to summarize information from model outputs. So far implemented only for chain convergence.

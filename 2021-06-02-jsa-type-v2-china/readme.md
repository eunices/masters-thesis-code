Dear Eunice,

For China it doesnâ€™t matter so much precisely which analyses/data are available. Any credible figure/table (could be simple) would be welcome. So if interested I would block off a small amount of time and do whatever is easiest/fastest in that order. 

Of most interest would be the future description projection. Also of interest anything spatial such as simple map of the type data, anything showing importance of Wu (whether in network or not), anything showing ongoing upward trend for the country, and anything showing historical overlap with other countries..

Will get to the comments but was distracted by some pressing matters the last couple of days.

Best wishes,
John

# Species distribution modelling covariates and resolution

## Potential sources

### Climatic variables

- WorldClim (Zeng et al. 2016)
  - [bio1-19](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/691/ds691.pdf)
- IPCC (Zeng et al. 2016)
  - tmp, dtr, frs, pre, cld, tmn, tmx, vap, wet

### Elevation

- Digital Elevation Model GMTED 2010 (Zeng et al. 2016)
- USGS HydroSHEDS (Zeng et al. 2016)
  - cond_dem, flow_accum, slope, aspect

### Vegetation

- USGS landcover (Zeng et al. 2016)
  - avg-MGVF

## Resolution

- Zeng et al. (2016): "Environmental variable layers were at a resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes and had a global extent (before limiting via buffer-ing) of −55–60◦N and −135–175◦E."
